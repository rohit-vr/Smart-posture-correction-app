This posture correction device collects data from 2 types of sensors- a "flex sensor", which measures bend in the spine and an "ultrasonic sensor" which measures distance from the backrest.
The microcontroller used for this project is Arduino UNO which uses a bluetooth module to wireless transmit the collected sensor data to the mobile application built using MIT app inventor,
which refreshes in real time to show your posture details and sends appropriate warnings if it exceeds the threshold values.
